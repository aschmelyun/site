# Andrew Schmelyun's Site

This is the source code behind my site, [aschmelyun.com](https://aschmelyun.com). Right now it's built with [Cleaver](https://github.com/aschmelyun/cleaver), another one of my projects, and compiled with Docker and GitHub actions on push.

If you want to start your own blog with Cleaver or tinker around with this one, feel free to clone this and ask any questions!
